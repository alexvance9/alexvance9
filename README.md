Hey there! I am a creative and values-focused software engineer and web developer, with training from App Academy's 960hr Full Stack bootcamp curriculum. I have a long history in customer service and service industry fields. Currently I am working with small local businesses, building static and e-commerce websites on a freelance basis. Variety is the spice of life! Always working on projects both code-based and flour-based. Ask me what I'm working on now, it might leave you hungry  for more!  👩‍🍳 ✨ 👩‍💻
